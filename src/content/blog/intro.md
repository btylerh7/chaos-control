Welcome to my new blog! My name is Tyler. What do I even call myself at this point? I would say I am a front-end developer, a musician, and a language learner.
Although, as you are going to see with this blog itself, my interests are far more varied than these three areas of interest. My plan is for this to be my
chaotic but somewhat managed everything blog. If you are only here for one topic, I plan on having categories for you to filter out my other stuff, don't worry!

A little bit about me so you can understand my background. I was rasised in an extremely religious Christian household in Alabama, and I love analyzing the
texts I was raised on in a more scholarly and critical light to understand them in their own context. You'll probably see me religious trauma posting every now
and then. My dad plays piano, and I have been learning music since I was six. I have a music education degree, and I love music theory and production more than
anything. I play guitar, piano, and trumpet mainly, but that is not all that I can play.

I was a music teacher for two years before I made the jump to programming. I love music, but the teaching job was not fitting of my mental health. I was not
enjoying interacting with large groups of children and having to maintain control of the classroom. I also realized that I really loved programming after
one of my coworkers introduced me to it. I mostly work in front-end development for my job, but I also enjoy doing backend development and mobile development.

As part of my deep dive into tech, I have spent a large amount of time learning about privacy and how it is being attacked by large corporations like Google
and Meta (Facebook). I value my privacy deeply, which is why you are not going to find a lot of personally identifiable information about me on here beyond
my name. And I will also stress, if you do happen to find something personally identifiable about me somewhere, no you didn't. Well, tell me you did first so
I can fix that. Then after that, no you didn't.

I watched a decent amount of anime when I was in high school, but one of my friends at university got me to binge all of Jojo's Bizzare Adventure parts 1-5 in
the summer of 2019, and ever since then, I have been in love with anime, manga, and the Japanese language. Expect to see my thoughts on series I read or watch
on this blog, along with some posts about my experience learning Japanese. Maybe even some posts **in** Japanese as well.

Oh, and if you can't tell from the name of this blog, I love Sonic the Hedgehog. I grew up playing mostly Sonic games. My most fond memories are of the Sonic
Adventure games and Sonic Heroes, but I have pretty much played all of them that were available for the GameBoy Advance, GameCube, Wii, DS, and 3DS. And I have
also played some of the more recent ones like Sonic Frontiers on the PS5. If you still can't tell by the name of this blog, my favorite character is Shadow 
the Hedgehog.

There are so many more random interests I have. Can you tell I'm autistic? Because I didn't realize it until not too long ago, and it has helped me to better
understand how my brain works and to embrace the chaos of all of my interests. Where will the chaos take us next? Let's find out. Chaos... Control!
